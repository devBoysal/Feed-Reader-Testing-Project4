# Project Overview

In this project scenario we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.
The original developer of this application have already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).
Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.


## What I've learnt

I've learnt that testing is an important part of the development process known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

I've now learnt how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against pre-existing applications. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
